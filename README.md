AWS CloudWatch & Grafana Integration â€“ A Mini-Project on EC2 & Load Balancer Monitoring ðŸš€
ðŸ”¹ Project: Real-time Monitoring of EC2 Instances & Load Balancer using AWS CloudWatch & Grafana
ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: AWS (EC2, ALB, CloudWatch, IAM, S3, RDS, Glue) | Grafana | Python | Bash

ðŸ“Œ Overview:
Monitoring is crucial for cloud-based applications to ensure optimal performance, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues efficiently. In this project, I integrated AWS CloudWatch with Grafana to visualize real-time metrics for both EC2 instances and Application Load Balancer (ALB).

ðŸ”¹ Steps Followed:
âœ… 1. Set Up AWS CloudWatch Metrics for EC2 & ALB

Collected CPUUtilization, NetworkIn, NetworkOut for EC2
Monitored Request Count, 2XX requests, and Latency for ALB
Configured IAM roles with CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess
âœ… 2. Created Grafana Data Source for CloudWatch

Integrated Grafana with AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring
Defined EC2 Instance ID & Target Groups as Dynamic Variables
âœ… 3. Configured Dynamic Queries in Grafana

EC2 Graph: Used $server_ip to track instance performance
ALB Graph: Used $target_group to track request distribution
âœ… 4. Visualized Key Metrics in Grafana Dashboard

CPU Utilization, Network Traffic for EC2
Request Count & Error Rates for ALB
âœ… 5. Load Testing & Debugging

Simulated requests using curl to validate data flow
Verified logs in CloudWatch & Grafana Query Inspector
ðŸ“Š Key Learnings:
ðŸ”¸ How to configure AWS CloudWatch & IAM roles for metric collection
ðŸ”¸ Building dynamic Grafana dashboards with CloudWatch as a data source
ðŸ”¸ Using Grafana variables to make monitoring scalable & flexible
ðŸ”¸ Debugging data flow using AWS CloudWatch Logs & Query Inspector

This project helped me gain hands-on experience in cloud monitoring, AWS observability, and real-time dashboarding! ðŸŽ¯
